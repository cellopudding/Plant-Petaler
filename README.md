# Plant-Petaler

## Description
We built a scalable, user-focused MERN app that enables plant lovers to shop online for indoor and outdoor plants. We combined a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. In addition, we integrated the Stripe payment platform for a safe and easy checkout experience.

## Installation
To invoke our application, use the following commands:

npm install
npm start

## Usage
Once the application is invoked, the user is presented with the entire inventory on the home page. At the top of the page underneath the header lies a menu which gives the user the option to display indoor or outdoor plants. The user can click each plant to display a details page showing information about that plant. The header of the page offers a signup/login icon which gives access to each of those forms as well as a shopping cart icon to view plants ready to be purchased. The footer of the page contains icons for social media following as well as the main technologies used which link to each technologies' homepage for further information.<br>
This application is being hosted on [Heroku](https://plant-petaler.herokuapp.com/).<br>
